                                <h4 class="mar-bot-10px">Pros of Raw Food Diets</h4>

                                <p>Raw food diets are more natural for dogs and cats. Their ancestors ate raw meat and
                                    bones, so
                                    their bodies are better equipped to digest and absorb nutrients from raw food.
                                    <br>Raw food diets are typically higher in protein and lower in carbohydrates than
                                    commercial pet
                                    foods. This can be beneficial for pets with weight loss or weight management goals,
                                    as well as
                                    pets with certain health conditions such as diabetes or pancreatitis. <br>Raw food
                                    diets can help to improve your pet's overall health and well-being. Studies have
                                    shown that dogs and cats on raw food diets have healthier skin and coats, stronger
                                    teeth and
                                    gums, and improved energy levels.
                                </p>


                                <h4 class="mar-bot-10px">Cons of Raw Food Diets</h4>
                                <p> Raw food diets can be more expensive than commercial pet foods. <br>Raw food diets
                                    can be more time-consuming to prepare. <br>There is a risk of foodborne illness if
                                    the raw food is not handled properly. <br> Raw food diets may not be suitable for
                                    all pets, such as those with certain health conditions or
                                    allergies. <br> If you are considering switching your pet to a raw food diet, it is
                                    important to talk to your
                                    veterinarian first. They can help you to make sure that a raw food diet is right for
                                    your pet and
